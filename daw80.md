🇾🇪 Aden, Yemen 🥂 _şereffe_
--------------------------

The middle east is tricky to theme cocktails around, being largely dry countries.
Luckily, in the 1870s, "The Yemen" was mostly under the control of the Ottoman empire
(save the British port of Aden, important with the 1869 Suez canal opening), which is
[perhaps the most relaxed][relaxed] Muslim community with regard to alcohol,
specifically Raki and wine.
In addition, Cynar is a primarily artichoke-based liquor, which is nicely desert-y.
