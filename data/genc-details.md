GENC Details
============

U.S. Recognition
----------------

- **Independent**: A territory constituting an independent State; in particular, a people politically organized into a sovereign State with a definite territory recognized as independent by the United States Government.
- **Other**: A territory that is neither recognized by the United States Government as an independent State nor is a United States dependency. The U.S. Recognition Note for the entry, if any, provides additional information.
- **U.S. Dependency**: A non-independent territory of the United States for which the United States Government exercises one or more facets of government administration or policy.

GENC Status
-----------

- **Exception**: An ISO 3166/MA Officially Assigned code element that is included in the GENC Standard, but whose associated entry content varies from the specification given by ISO 3166/MA, based on differences in naming (some politically significant, others simply stylistic) as approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and/or differences in how the territorial extent of an entity is understood.
- **Exclusion**: An ISO 3166/MA Officially Assigned code element that shall not be included in the GENC Standard.
- **Exigent**: A code (and associated entry content) in the GENC Standard that is not permitted by ISO 3166/MA, because it uses an assignment that does not conform to the ISO specification (for example: consists of a mixture of alphabetic and numeric characters, when only alphabetic characters are allowed by ISO 3166/MA).
- **Extension**: A code (and associated entry content) in the GENC Standard that is permitted by ISO 3166/MA but is not an ISO Officially Assigned code element.
- **ISO**: An ISO 3166/MA Officially Assigned code element that is included in the GENC Standard.

Entry Status
------------

- **Unchanged**: The entry is unchanged from the prior entry for the same item in the standard.
