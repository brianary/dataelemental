![SelectXmlExtensions.dll: no version numbers](images/version-missing.png)

While creating my first binary PowerShell module, which just happened to also be my first .NET Core/Standard project,
I ran into trouble trying to set the assembly version info on the DLL.

```text
PS C:\> ls SelectXmlExtensions.dll |% VersionInfo

ProductVersion   FileVersion      FileName
--------------   -----------      --------
                                  SelectXmlExtensions.dll
```

The aborted [xproj][] / [project.json] formats for early .NET Core versions polluted my search results.
Those also meant that I'd have to be pretty careful about how recent any proposed solutions were, particularly
since I was using the .NET Core SDK 3.0. But how old was too old?

I found SDK issues [#967][] and [#1098][], and I tried the whole version prefix & suffix thing, updating
my fsproj with `<VersionPrefix>1.0.0</VersionPrefix>` and ran `dotnet build --version-suffix beta`, but
despite being the most up-to-date info, this didn't work.
Sometimes Microsoft does a great job of documenting stuff that won't be released for some time, so maybe
I had to watch out for info that was too new, as well.

I found [more][] [suggestions][], so I added `<Version>1.0.0</Version>` to my fsproj and rebuilt,
I added `/p:Version=1.0.0` or `/p:AssemblyVersion=1.0.0` to the command line and rebuilt, and nothing worked.
I tried creating a [Directory.Build.props][]
I even tried creating an _AssemblyInfo.fs_ file which I hadn't done by hand for a while, and added
`<GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>` and `<Compile Include="Properties\AssemblyInfo.fs" />`
to the fsproj and tried again, but nothing changed.

###### Directory.Build.props

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

###### Properties\AssemblyInfo.fs

```fsharp
namespace SelectXmlExtensions
open System.Reflection
open System.Runtime.CompilerServices
open System.Runtime.InteropServices
[<assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")>]
[<assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")>]
do()
```

What was really puzzling me was that it seemed like the people getting these answers were successful,
but they were probably using a different version of the tools than I was.
Sometimes I would find [unanswered questions][unanswered], so maybe I wasn't alone with this problem.

I'd gradually built a pretty decent script for rerunning clean builds, though.

I found a what seemed to be [a pretty definitive article][corever] on all of this, but it didn't help either.

I decided that I'd made a pretty thorough effort, so I filed [an issue][issue].
I was a little surprised when a fix was promised in .NET Core 3.1.
It made me wonder if I could use an older feature of an older .NET Core toolset to work around the problem while I waited for the fix.

I uninstalled the .NET Core SDK 3.0.100, then installed 2.2.402, and even 2.1.802, but it didn't seem to
be a problem with the version of the tooling. One or more of these methods should have worked in 2.x.

Then I decided to try one more thing.

It didn't work. But now I know that I'll have to wait for a fix, or manually add version info
with some kind of [external tool][].

With this broken for _so long_, on top of the lack of F# support in tools like [Add-Type][] and [xsd.exe],
Microsoft has to earn back a lot of credibility before claiming F# as a first-class language
with full support again.
