> **Note:** In earlier versions of the .NET Framework, the [Shfusion.dll](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/34149zk3.aspx) Windows shell extension enabled you to install assemblies by dragging them in File Explorer. Beginning with the .NET Framework 4, Shfusion.dll is obsolete.

> **Note:** Gacutil.exe is only for development purposes and should not be used to install production assemblies into the global assembly cache.
